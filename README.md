# FFT12
Just a little implementation of a FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) in Verilog for real vectors of length 12. All the theory is available in the article called "A Minimum Multiplicative Complexity Algorithm
for Discrete Linear Transforms in CBA form", created by the professors G.Jer√¥nimo da Silva Jr. and R. M. Campello de Souza.

1)cbaFFT12.v is a verilog file that implements the FFT function for a vector of length 12.
2)testbench.v is just a simple testbench.
3)cbaFFT12.sce is a scilab file created for sketching purposes, it is very similar to the verilog one, but way more simple.
